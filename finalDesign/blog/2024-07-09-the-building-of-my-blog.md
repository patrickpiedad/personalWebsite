I created my portfolio website as part of the 100Devs training that I'm currently working through. One of the tips that were given were to use a template to build the base for your website, unless you're a designer that already has the knowledge to do so. 

So that's what I did, and that's what you're reading this blog on right now! Quick shout out to HTML5 Up templates for giving a great starting point for devs like myself.

Now if you're in the tech space, it won't take long for you to stumble upon the idea of documenting your journey in public, both for your own development AND to give employers an idea of who you are as a developer. Great advice.

Putting those pieces together, I asked myself, "How can I build a blog on my portfolio site?" 

It proved to be not-as-straight-forward as I originally though it would be.

I had heard about all kinds of different options for blogs, such as WordPress, GitHub Pages, Hugo, etc... The list goes on. I found myself overwhelmed with the number of options as well as the complexity of learning another technology and trying to figure out how to integrate that with my current portfolio website. Would I have to build a backend? How do I even make blog posts, hard-coding the HTML / MD files? 

All great questions.

And then I stumbled upon 11ty, a simple static site generator.
