Because they told me to.

Just kidding (kind of).

I recently decided to write about my software development journey for a few different reasons, but here's the main one:

<b>Writing about my learning path gives me a place to reflect on all the things that I've learned so far.</b>

<br>

Really simple, right? I agree. However, I think there is a lot of value in this "simple fact idea."

For example, I've been (seriously) studying software development for the last six months. I'll be the first to say, it has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Looking back to when I first started, I'm floored by the amount of progress that's been made. From struggling to write basic HTML syntax, to now developing my own website (with the help of others) and using new technologies like Javascript and 11ty to create blog functionality.

As I move continue to progress, I want to be able to look back and see my progress. I think its a wonderful way to appreciate your personal efforts pursuing something you're passionate about (and I'm absolutely terrible at this).

Writing about my learning path also forces me to internalize the concepts that I'm learning about. Its one thing to go through problem sets like manipulating arrays and using "Math.reduce" to find required values. Its another thing to describe your learning process and "teach" it to your audience.

<i>Additionally, I think it provides value to those that are looking to pursue the same path. </i>

I'm currently a military intelligence officer working to transition into the tech industry in Germany. While the military experience gave me many soft skills that will prove helpful later on, it did not teach me any of the technical skills that I need to be successful in software development.

That's probably one of the top concerns that transitioning service members have, "not having a technical skill to become employed" (unless you were a server tech in the Army, in which case, more power to you).

Documenting the path that I'm taking will hopefully show others that absolutely possible, with a little bit of work, to make the transition. 

Outside of those reasons, there are a multitude of others to include:

<ol>
<li> It required me to build some sort of platform to share my knowledge. which is a great way to learn in itself.</li>
<li> It builds my personal brand for potential employers, colleagues, and strangers on the internet to see.</li>
<li> It gives my mom a reason to be proud of me (right, mom?) </li>
<li> It gives me an outlet to organize the never-ending stream of thoughts in my head</li>
</ol>

So, if you're thinking about writing about your journey, let me another person to encourage it.

If you're wondering if software development is for you, then let's connect and we can wander the path together. 

And if you're a 5 foot short, Filipino lady with a cute but very talkative Yorki Terrier, hi mom!

Cheers,
