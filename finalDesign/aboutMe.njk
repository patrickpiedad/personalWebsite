								<h3>My Story</h3>
								<p>I went to university on a United States Army scholarship, solidifying my future as both an Armor and Intelligence Officer.
								I spent most of my military career stationed in Bavaria, Germany, where I met my beautiful wife, Theresa. After getting
								married, we decided that I would leave the military and we would put our roots down, here in Germany.</p>

								<p>As a result, I needed to find a new career that I could pursue, that would also give me the passion and drive that I found
								serving. After a lot of self reflection, working to figure out what I really enjoyed in my military career, I found myself turning to tech.
								Fast forward a bit, I am happily using my software development and technical project management background to solve challenging problems.</p>

								<p>This journey has taken me through the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy, also known as MSSA, and landed my current role in Cloud. As I begin this next season of life, I look forward to growing with a new team in an exciting environment.</p>
