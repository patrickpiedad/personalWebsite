<h1 align="center"> My Personal Website </h1>
This is the repository used to build my personal website. My personal website was one of my first major coding endeavors. It serves as both a holder for my software developer portfolio and a project in itself. Check it out at https://patrickpiedad.netlify.app/

<h1 align="center"> How It's Made </h1>
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTML5 Up, 11ty, Netlify
<br></br>
The base template is used from HTML5 Up, which gave a great starting point for the website. I learned a lot about the power of JavaScript through exploring the code base and tinkering with various components. Through trial and error, I made many changes to the code in order to make my website unique to me.
<br></br>
I also added blog functionality to the website through the use of 11ty to enable static site generation and Netlify as the host. This component addition made this project extremely rewarding, as it can now hold not only my introduction information and projects, but also my thoughts that I want to offer to the world.

<h1 align="center"> Lessons Learned </h1>
This project taught me a lot about the extent of what JavaScript can do. The fine tuning of animations and event handlers can really bring a website to life and provide an incredible user experience.
<br></br>
I also learned about statis site generation and the reusable bits of code that can be paired with your "front matter" to create a streamlined code base for future content additions.
